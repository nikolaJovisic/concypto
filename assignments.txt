Assgnment 1 (concypto_v1.py -> concypto_v2.py):

    Update concypto_v1.py in such a way so it supports the following features:

        1. CPO (concypto coin) is distributed in fixed amount to every new user when he joins the system in a special transaction.
        2. There is no upper limit to total amount of CPOs. 
        3. Validators do not dispose of any coins.
        4. Every transaction now contains a list of references to transactions in which sender recieved coins he intends to spend.
            4a. Only validated transactions can be referenced for spending.
        5. Whole amount of referenced transactions must be spent, so any surplus is payed back to sender.
        6. This implies that transaction now, instead of a reciever, contains a list of receivers.
        7. Malitious users are added. They try to double-spend and to spend more than they have.
        8. Validators never validate malitious transactions. 
            8a. Bonus points if you think of a way to make them not iterate trough whole list of previous transactions to check for double-spend.

    ...

    Waiting transaction are in form of a tuple where items are:

        0. Transaction ID
        1. Sender ID
        2. List of transactions it is referencing to
        3. List of tuples (pairs) of:
            3a. Reciever ID
            3b. Amount to be sent to 3a
        4. Time of making this transaction

    Validated transaction are in form of a tuple where items are:

        0. Transaction ID
        1. Sender ID
        2. List of transactions it is referencing to
        3. List of tuples (pairs) of:
            3a. Reciever ID
            3b. Amount to be sent to 3a
        4. Time of making this transaction
        5. Validator ID
        6. Time of validation this transaction

    Good luck!
